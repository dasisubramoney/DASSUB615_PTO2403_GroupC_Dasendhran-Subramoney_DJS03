- The rationale behind the refactoring decisions made, including the choice of objects and functions.

Creating the BookList class allows for all the code to be grouped together which enhances readability and modularity. By creating different methods it makes it easier to maintain and debug the program. By creating the functions to help the methods it reduces duplication and improve clarity.

- How abstraction has made the code more maintainable and extendable.

By adding specific methods for a different use. Each method does only one thing. This makes the code easier to test and extend because you can add new features or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

- Any challenges faced during the refactoring process and how they were overcome.

One challenge was deciding how to break down the code into it's different methods and creating functions hich could be reused.
Solution: I looked at each piece of functionality and grouped similar code groups together and ensuring that methods were not too large and focused on a single task

- Reflections on how this exercise has deepened your understanding of JavaScript programming concepts.

Creating classes showed me that you can make coding large projects much more simple and more reusable. Which will in turn make coding alot for easier and time effective.
